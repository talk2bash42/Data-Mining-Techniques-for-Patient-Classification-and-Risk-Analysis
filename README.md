# Advanced Analytics in Healthcare: Data Mining Techniques for Patient Classification and Risk Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance decision-making in healthcare through advanced data mining techniques. By leveraging machine learning models and clustering algorithms, we classify and cluster patients based on their health status, identifying high-risk groups for specific diseases. This initiative supports healthcare providers by improving patient treatment plans and optimizing resource allocation.

## Objective

- **Classify** patients into risk categories using supervised learning models to predict patient risks.
- **Cluster** patient data using unsupervised learning to uncover hidden patterns in health conditions.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values, feature scaling, and outlier management to prepare the dataset for analysis.

### Supervised Learning
- Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
- Evaluate model performance through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores.

### Unsupervised Learning
- Techniques: K-Means clustering enhanced by PCA.
- Analysis of clusters to identify intrinsic groupings related to various health conditions.

## Key Findings

- The Random Forest classifier demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of approximately 98.59%.
- Clustering revealed natural groupings within the data, providing additional insights into patient health conditions not evident through classification alone.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For all backend operations and model training.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and graphical representations.
